Test project for using Rust graphics using Piston and gfx-rs

The goals of this project are to build something arbitrary using gfx-rs and Piston to learn how they work, so that I
can eventually contribute something meaningful to the projects themselves.

Goals:

  * A 2D particle system (expanding on the Triangle example)
  * A 3D particle system (expanding on the Cube example)
  * Move the particle system to Piston
  
That's it for now - small initial goals are more productive than something ridiculous.
